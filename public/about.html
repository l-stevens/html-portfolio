<h1>About Laurie</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/IMG_20240317_1534.png" width="200" alt="Laurie skiing."/>
<p>Professionally, I'm a former journalist who, no longer being able to see my profession soiled with the mud of conflict-mongering, moved to a different professiom. I design sites and produce a variety of other content. I'm now looking to add coding to my tool kit.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm an upbeat introvert. I prefer time to myself and a few people with whom I connect. I'm also a learning addict and very studious. I can be serious and earnest but I also love a good distraction. Comedy is one of my favorite distractions. Time in nature (especially mountains and Alpine lakes) is another favorite of mine. I love swimming, skiing and important conversations about fascinating topics. I adore my fur kids and I'm terribly fond of my longtime partner.</p>
