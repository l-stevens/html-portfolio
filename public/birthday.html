<h1>The whole world celebrates my birthday!</h1>
<h2><em>Don't be left out. RSVP now for December 31.</em></h2>

<hr />
<p>Get ready to travel back to a time when the U.S. was coming out of the Depression as well as Prohibition and the witty, wonderful crime-fighting duo, Nick and Nora Charles, were the talk of the town for both their parties and their ability to bring down the bad guys! Period dress is suggested. Expect highballs and cocktails - the long and the short of it. Thin Man movies will run throughout the night. Champagne at midnight, of course. Not just to ring in the year, but to celebrate Laurie's Day! </p>
