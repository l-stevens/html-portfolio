<h1>Laurie's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>These are a few of my favorite things... err... movies!</h2>

<h3>Godfather I</h3>

<p>Though I really dislike the graphic violence in these movies, I have overcome that aversion because of the movie's dramatic, though not gritty, realism. Farm from being gritty like other movies of its time, this movie is shot with the loving care of a Vasquez painting. The cinematogrophy is gorgeous with dramatic lighting contrasts based in rich golds, soft blacks and muted natural tones. But, what stands out most about this movie is the fascinating way that the Director (Francis Ford Coppola) and writer (Mario Puzo) cause us to empathize with a benevolent crime boss and his once starry-eyed, war-hero and somewhat idealistic son. Michael Corleone takes over as the head of his crime family reluctantly and seems to be a winner at the end of the film. What fans, know, however, is that he is on a trajectory that will lead to the downfall of his very soul. This is an incredibly powerful film. Watch for the hospital scene if you want to see some of the best acting in all of cinema.</p>

<h3>Godfather II</h3>

<p>If you've seen Godfather I, you will understand why it's impossible to skip the greatest of all movie sequels -- Godfather II. Again, using cinematography that is gorgeous and rich in reference to the times it covers, the movie further addresses Michael Corleone's downfall. While his power in the mob world increases and solidifies, his personal relationships bear the brunt of his brutal decisions. What was once an honorable soul slowly gives way to a man who sees the world as a horrific, harsh place with no room for sentamentality -- even with those he loves.</p>

<h3>DeadPool 2</h3>

<p>I'm not all gloom and doom. And, oddly -- though I despise graphic violence in movies -- this one handles the violence in (believe it or not) such a silly way that we're left actually believing that this is a FAMILY movie. Ryan Reynold's innate sense of playful, irrevant humor is in full swing in this movie. Even if you don't care for superhero movies, you'll enjoy this movie because it's just a fun, energizing, action movie that has you rooting for the underdogs all the way. There are so many laughs in this movie that I watch it when life is beating me down.</p>
